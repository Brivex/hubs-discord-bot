# hubs-discord-bot

A Discord bot that interacts with [Mozilla Hubs](https://hubs.mozilla.com). Mostly bridges information (chat, media links, joins/leaves) and lets you see who is currently in Hubs from Discord.

To configure it, either create a `.env` file in the root directory with settings, or set equivalent environment
variables. You can see configurables in `.env.defaults`.

To run, after installing dependencies (`npm ci`) run `npm start` to start the server, connect to Discord and Reticulum,
and operate indefinitely.

Check out the bot in action on the [Hubs development Discord](https://discord.gg/wHmY4nd)!
