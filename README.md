# hubs-discord-bot

WIP implementation of a Discord bot that interacts with [Mozilla Hubs](https://hubs.mozilla.com).

To configure it, either create a `.env` file in the root directory with settings, or set equivalent environment
variables. You can see configurables in `.env.defaults`.

To run, after installing dependencies (`npm ci`) run `npm start` to start the server, connect to Discord and Reticulum,
and operate indefinitely.
